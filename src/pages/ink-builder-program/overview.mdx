# Ink Builder Program

The Ink Builder Program supports teams building on Ink with funding, guidance, and recognition across three tracks.

**Spark:** Microgrants for builders shipping tangible progress. Spark backs small, high-signal projects like tools, bots, mini dApps, and experiments that can deliver measurable value on Ink. It is also a path for teams that are promising but not yet at Forge's traction bar to prove impact and level up. Grants range from 500–5,000 USDC, with a lightweight application and fast review.

**Forge:** Our flagship track for teams scaling real products. Forge is built for projects with **live traction** and a clear plan to grow on Ink. Support includes **milestone-based grants up to 200,000 USDC**, hands-on ecosystem support, and exposure through Ink's channels. In select cases, we may back exceptional founders who are strongly aligned with Ink and have a credible path to breakout impact, but traction remains the primary bar.

**Echo:** A one-time retroactive track to recognize early projects that shipped on Ink **before November 1, 2025**. Echo rewards verifiable, shipped contributions with a one-time grant and public recognition.
