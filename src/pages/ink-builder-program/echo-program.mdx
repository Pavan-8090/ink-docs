# Echo Program

*If you shipped a product, tool, or onchain integration on Ink in the early days, Echo exists to recognize that work.*

## What Is Echo?

Echo is Ink's retroactive builder initiative, a one-time program to recognize and reward teams and projects that **shipped real product** on Ink during its early phase.

Echo exists to reward shipped contributions that helped form the ecosystem, and to reconnect those builders with what's coming next.

## Why We Created Echo

Ecosystems don't appear overnight, they're built through shipping.

Echo was created to:

- Recognize early projects that **deployed and delivered** on Ink before formal programs existed
- Reward contributions that created measurable ecosystem value (usage, transactions, adoption, integrations)
- Reconnect proven early builders with Ink's next chapter

Echo is about shipped work that moved the chain forward.

## Who It's For

Echo is for **projects and teams** that shipped on Ink in its early stage.

We're recognizing builders who:

- Shipped a **live product, tool, or integration** on Ink before Nov 1st, 2025
- Can provide verifiable proof of shipping (contracts, repos, releases, live links, metrics)
- Created real value for Ink users or builders through product usage or ecosystem utility

**Not in scope:** community-only contributions, advisory/support work, calls, moderation, marketing, or ideas/feedback without a shipped artifact.

## How It Works

Echo is designed to be clear, fast, and verifiable.

### 1. Submit

Application form: https://forms.inkonchain.com/echo-builder-program

Share a short summary of what you shipped:

- What you built
- When it launched on Ink
- Proof of work (required):
    - Contract addresses / explorer links
    - GitHub repo / commits
    - Live product link / screenshots
    - Usage metrics (if available)

### 2. Review

Ink Foundation reviewers (and ecosystem advisors when needed) evaluate submissions based on:

- **Shipping validity** (is it real and on Ink?)
- **Impact** (usage, transactions, adoption, integrations, ecosystem utility)
- **Authenticity** (credible proof, consistent story)

### 3. Reward

Approved projects receive a one-time retroactive grant, and an invitation to join the builder network for future initiatives.

## What You'll Get

Grant size varies based on what was shipped and its impact. Recognized projects receive:

- **Retroactive grant:** builder point or stablecoin award
- **Recognition:** public acknowledgment (optional if a project prefers privacy)
- **Reconnection:** invitation to private builder channels and early access to future initiatives

## How to Apply

1. **Submit your Echo application** with proof of what you shipped on Ink
2. **Review period (1–2 weeks):** submissions are batch-reviewed, clarification may be requested
3. **Grant + follow-up:** approved projects receive grant instructions and builder network access

## Looking Ahead

Ink is entering a new phase, and Echo is how we recognize the builders who shipped early and helped set the foundation.

We remember what you shipped.

Now let's build what comes next.
