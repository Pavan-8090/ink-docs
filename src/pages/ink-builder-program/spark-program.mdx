# Spark Program

*Every big idea starts with a spark.*

## What Is Spark?

Spark is Ink's microgrant track for builders shipping small, high-signal work that creates measurable value for the ecosystem.

It's built for tools, bots, mini dApps, public goods, and experimental products that can prove real usage, unlock onchain activity, or make building on Ink easier. Spark is also the right lane for promising teams that are not yet at Forge's traction bar, but can prove impact with a smaller push.

No pitch decks. Low lift application. Fast decisions.

This is where projects earn their first traction on Ink.

## Why We Built Spark

Healthy ecosystems are built by a lot of small, useful things that compound.

Spark exists to:

- Reduce friction for builders who are ready to ship, not just talk
- Buy velocity for projects that can quickly produce proof (usage, integrations, onchain activity)
- Seed high-potential teams that need a smaller milestone to qualify for deeper support later
- Encourage ecosystem primitives and public goods that increase builder throughput

Spark is not "fund anything." It is "fund what can ship value and show signal."

## Who Should Apply

Spark is a strong fit if you are:

- An indie builder or small team shipping a real product or feature
- A team building something useful for other builders or users on Ink
- A project that can show a credible plan for measurable impact, even if early
- A team that may have aimed for Forge but needs to prove traction first

Spark is not a fit for deck-first ideas, marketing-only teams, or projects that cannot define what value they create for Ink and how it will be measured.

## What You Can Build

Spark supports lightweight projects that increase usage, liquidity, or builder leverage, including:

- Developer tools, SDKs, contract tooling, deployment helpers
- Bots and mini apps that drive repeat onchain actions
- Onchain UX improvements, onboarding helpers, account abstraction components
- Analytics dashboards that help users act (not just view), especially if linked to conversion
- Public goods and open-source primitives other teams can reuse
- Consumer experiments with clear retention loops and measurable usage

## How It Works

### 1) Submit

Builders share a short application with:

- What they're building and why it matters for Ink
- Proof of build (demo, repo, screenshots, Loom, contracts, etc.)
- What they want to ship or improve with a $500–$5K microgrant
- Any traction signals (even small) and distribution plan (if relevant)

### 2) Review (Scorecard-Based)

We evaluate every submission on five criteria:

- **Proof of Build**
    
    Has real work already started, code/UI/prototype/demo, visible effort.
    
- **Ecosystem Usefulness**
    
    Does it make Ink more usable, more visible, or more fun, and does it help users or other builders.
    
- **Feasibility for Microgrant**
    
    Can $500–$5K meaningfully move it forward, with a clear and realistic scope.
    
- **Builder Credibility**
    
    Can the builder ship, communicate clearly, and respond reliably.
    
- **Creative + Value Spark**
    
    Is it novel, memeable, surprising, or culturally sticky, while still creating real value.

### 3) Decision + Grant

Outcomes:

- **Approved** (grant size confirmed)
- **Revise & resubmit** (scope or proof needs tightening)
- **Not a fit** (doesn't match Spark goals)

## What You Receive

### Microgrants

- **500–5,000 USDC** per project
- Non-dilutive, simple terms
- Typically paid after approval and confirmation of a working build/demo (timing depends on program operations and compliance)

### Visibility and Ecosystem Support

Standout Spark projects may receive:

- Social amplification and ecosystem highlights
- Introductions to relevant ecosystem teams and partners
- A clear path to "level up" into deeper support when traction is proven

## Spark Success Looks Like

Within the next phase, the project delivers:

- A live deployment or usable feature on Ink
- A measurable impact signal, such as:
    - real users or repeat usage
    - meaningful onchain activity (transactions, volume)
    - adoption by other builders (integrations, reuse, tooling usage)
    - clear improvements to conversion or usability

If a project cannot explain the value it creates for Ink and how that value will be measured, it is not a fit.
