# Forge Program

The future isn't written. It's waiting to be inked.

## What is Forge?

Forge is Ink's flagship track for teams ready to scale real traction into real impact. Forge provides milestone-based funding, advisory support, and access to the broader ecosystem for builders shipping dApps, infrastructure, and the tools that expand what's possible on Ink. In select cases, we may also back exceptional founders with a clear path to breakout impact.

This is where traction turns into compounding growth.

## Why We Built Forge

Every serious builder hits a moment where the idea is real, the product is live, and users are showing up. The next phase isn't "can we build it," it's can we scale it and make it last.

Forge exists for that moment.

It's built for teams past the demo stage, ready to sharpen execution, expand distribution, and grow with intent, with Ink as the primary home.

We're selective so we can stay hands-on. If you're in Forge, you're not just getting funding, you're getting real support.

## Who Should Apply

Forge is a strong fit for teams with real momentum and a clear plan to scale on Ink.

You'll likely be a match if you have:

- A product that's live, or launching on mainnet imminently
- Meaningful traction, with clear usage signals (users, volume, TVL, integrations, or growth)
- A scoped 30–60 day plan with measurable outcomes
- A team that can execute independently, with strong ownership
- A credible plan to sustain delivery (runway, revenue strategy, or fundraising readiness)
- A clear reason why Ink is the best home for your next stage

In select cases, we may back exceptional founders with a clear vision and strong alignment with Ink, especially if we see breakout potential and a credible path to execution and impact.

If you're still exploring ideas or building your first MVP, **Spark** will be a better starting point.

## What You Receive

Forge is more than a grant. It's a scaling layer around your team.

**Support includes:**

- Milestone-based grants up to 200,000 USDC
- Strategic mentorship from Ink contributors and advisors
- Ink-native integrations and dev tooling support
- Official ecosystem spotlight and social amplification
- Warm intros to partners, collaborators, and investors
- Eligibility for follow-on investment via Kraken Ventures

## What We're Looking For

We select projects based on traction, product strength, execution maturity, ecosystem impact, and long-term durability.

### 1) Traction

We look for strong signals that real users want what you've built, such as:

- Active users or repeat usage
- Onchain transactions or volume
- TVL or assets under management
- Protocol/tooling integrations
- Sustained growth tied to product activity

We may also selectively support standout founders (e.g., viral project creators or exceptional alumni from top builder ecosystems) if we believe they can rapidly scale into high-impact Ink-native products.

### 2) Ecosystem Impact

We prioritize projects that materially push Ink forward through:

- Liquidity, volume, or capital efficiency
- User adoption and retention
- Infrastructure other teams depend on
- Developer tooling leverage or ecosystem distribution

### 3) Execution Readiness

Forge is designed for teams that can ship reliably, operate independently, and build to last.

We'll look for:

- Strong product/engineering track record
- Clear ownership and decision-making
- Ability to deliver without heavy incubation
- Financial readiness: a credible runway plan, and the ability to secure ongoing resources (revenue or fundraising) as the market evolves

> Strong signals include prior fundraising experience, warm investor relationships, or a clear path to extending runway as the market evolves.

### 4) Milestone Clarity

Forge grants are milestone-based, so your roadmap matters.

We look for:

- A 30–60 day plan
- Deliverables tied to outcomes (usage, adoption, integrations, liquidity)
- A realistic scope and timeline

## What You Can Build

Forge supports projects that make Ink more powerful, useful, and scalable.

Common categories include:

- DeFi protocols & liquidity infrastructure
- Developer tooling, infra, SDKs, APIs
- Wallet UX, onboarding improvements, account abstraction
- Consumer + social apps
- Games, prediction markets, coordination networks
- Public goods + open-source primitives

If it materially improves Ink's ecosystem, it belongs here.

## How the Forge Review Works

**Step 1: Apply (Biweekly Review)**

Apply anytime. The Ink Foundation team reviews applications in **biweekly batches**.

You can expect a feedback email within **~14 days** of submitting a complete application.

**Step 2: Interview + Deep Review**

If shortlisted, we'll invite your team to an interview to validate fit and readiness across:

- Product and traction
- Team structure and execution ability
- Ecosystem alignment
- Long-term goals

**Step 3: Milestone Planning + Grant Approval**

If you pass the interview round, we'll work together to finalize:

- Grant size and milestone structure
- Roadmap checkpoints and success metrics
- Integration needs and ecosystem support
- Co-marketing opportunities (when relevant)

Once milestones are agreed, we issue final approval and funding is released in stages based on delivery.
